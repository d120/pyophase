                The Ophase starts with the welcome meeting for all new computer science students. After that, several
                important topics will be explained. Topics are for example how to create an examination plan
                (Pr√ºfungsplan), how to select courses and anything else you need to know for a successful start at TU
                Darmstadt. Especially the presentation by the student advisory service (Studienberatung) will be
                important. It provides information about examination regulations, TUCaN and other relevant topics.

                The Master Ophase is made for each student starting a master's degree. We are going to show you the
                city, the university as well as the computer science department. We also will talk about cultural
                differences in Germany that you maybe did not know yet. Furthermore we offer a get-together for you
                which gives you the possibility to start new friendships with your fellow students.
