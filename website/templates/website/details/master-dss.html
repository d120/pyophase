<h3>Content and Schedule</h3>
<p>
    The Ophase starts with the welcome meeting for all new computer science students. After that, the students starting
    a Master's degree will gather into several groups. These groups provide space for explaining different important
    topics and answering your questions. Topics are for example how to create an examination plan (Pr√ºfungsplan), how to
    select courses and anything else you need to know for a successful start at TU Darmstadt. Especially important is
    the presentation by the student advisory service (Studienberatung) with information about examination regulations,
    TUCaN, and other relevant topics.
</p>
<p>This is the Ophase schedule, starting October 11th, 2016:</p>
